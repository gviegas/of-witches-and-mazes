/// A component that provides an entity with modifiers to apply on damage caused/taken.
///
/// The formulae used to adjust a given `amount` of damage are:
///
///     amount + (amount * damageCaused)
///     amount + (amount * damageTaken)
///
/// This allows for negative values to decrease damage. For example, setting the following values:
///
///     damageCaused = -0.3
///     damageTaken = 1.0
///
/// Will decrease the amount of damage caused by 30% and will double the amount of damage taken.
///
/// - Note: Although adjustments can be set to values outside the predefined `-1.0...2.0` range,
///   they will be clamped when using the class methods to retrieve them and/or apply damage
///   adjustment. This allows for different sources to mutate this values and then redo the
///   modifications without worrying about clamped values.
