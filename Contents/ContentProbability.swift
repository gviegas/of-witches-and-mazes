/// A class that specifies a content probability, used for random generation of contents.
///
/// The main purpose of this class is to define how to generate contents for a single `Room` instance.
/// Note that the content rules may change the way the other properties are to be interpreted. For example,
/// a content with `creationRule` set as `exactlyOnce` does not need to have a weight value, and the densities
/// may not matter if this is the only content type defined.
///
class ContentProbability {
    
    /// The rules associated with the contents to be created.
    ///
    let rules: [ContentType: ContentRule]
    
    /// The weights associated with the contents to be created.
    ///
    let weights: [ContentType: Double]
    
    /// The amount of room area to be filled with content.
    ///
    /// It must be a range between 0.0 and 1.0, where a value of 0.0 will leave the room
    /// empty and a value of 1.0 will fill the whole area.
    ///
    let roomDensity: ClosedRange<Double>
    
    /// The amount of corridor area to be filled with content.
    ///
    /// It must be a range between 0.0 and 1.0, where a value of 0.0 will leave the corridor
    /// empty and a value of 1.0 will fill the whole area.

    let corridorDensity: ClosedRange<Double>
    
    /// Created a new instance from the given values.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - rules: A dictionary of content types and the rules associated with them.
