        The character stats are located at the left side. By defeating enemies, new levels are attained and \
        the character becomes more powerful.

        The inventory is located at the center. The topmost row represents the equipped items, while the \
        remaining slots represent the stashed items. Stashed items cannot be used in dungeons and will not \
        provide bonuses to the character - they must be equipped to do so.

        The skills are located at the right side. Attaining new levels will award skill points, which can then \
        be used to unlock new skills. Skills may differ in cost, and they can be unlocked in any order.

        The available options are show in the bottom.
