/// A protocol that defines the UI element.
///
/// An element of the UI is any representable thing tha can provide a node to be
/// added to the final interface. `UIElement` instances are held by `UIContainers`,
/// which call the `provideNodeFor(rect:)` method of the element to obtain its node.
/// The `rect` parameter of the aforementioned method defines the exactly bounds of the
/// container - elements must use it to adapt to different UI positions and dimensions.
///
/// - Note: Although `UIContainer`s will correctly position themselves relative to other
///   containers of an `UITree`, they know nothing about the `UIElement`s being added.
///   A container can hold many elements, and they will all receive the same `rect`
///   boundary on `provideNodeFor(rect:)`, so the elements must be aware of their siblings.
