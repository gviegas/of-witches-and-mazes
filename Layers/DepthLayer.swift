    /// a `Maze` with cell size of 256 points and room size of 30 cells could have up to
    /// 12 rows of rooms, which should be more than enough for a single sublevel of a
    /// `Level` instance. In any case, it is safer to stay within this range, otherwise
    /// the computations may become unstable.

    /// This range is meant for UI-like things associated with an entity, like floating
    /// bars and labels.
